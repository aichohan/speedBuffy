A zero-install ASCII speed test for Linux/Raspberry Pi systems.

## 🤔 Why speedBuffy?

You often need a quick, clean speed test without installing packages or heavy binaries. SpeedBuffy is a zero-install script that uses native Linux tools to measure latency, download, and upload speeds, with live ASCII visuals and JSON for CI/automation.

speedBuffy relies only on common tools found in most Linux distributions:
- `bash` - For script execution
- `curl` - For download/upload tests
- `ping` - For latency tests
- `awk` - For calculations
- `tput` - For terminal formatting
- `coreutils` - For basic operations (date, dd, etc.)

## 📋 Usage

### Quick Examples

```bash
# Run with interactive menu
./speedBuffy.sh

# Run quick test with visuals and exit
./speedBuffy.sh --quick

# Output JSON to stdout
./speedBuffy.sh --json

# Save JSON to timestamped file
./speedBuffy.sh --save-json

# Save JSON to specific file
./speedBuffy.sh --out-json results.json

# Run quick test with custom download size
./speedBuffy.sh --size 50 --quick
```

### ⚙️ Command Line Options

```
Options:
  --quick               Run full visual test and exit
  --json                Output JSON to stdout only, no visuals
  --save-json           Like --json + save to timestamped file
  --out-json FILE       Like --json + save to specified FILE
  --size MB             Set download size in MB (default: 100)
  --dlcap SEC           Set download time cap in seconds (default: 30)
  --ulcap SEC           Set upload time cap in seconds (default: 30)
  --ipv 4|6|auto        Set IP version preference (default: auto)
  --no-color            Disable colored output
  --color               Force colored output
  --debug               Write verbose logs to /tmp/speedbuffy.log
  -h, --help            Show this help message
```

### Menu Mode

When run without arguments, SpeedBuffy presents an interactive menu:

1. **Quick Test** - Runs latency, download, and upload tests in sequence
2. **Latency Test Only** - Measures packet loss, average latency, and jitter
3. **Download Test Only** - Measures download speed
4. **Upload Test Only** - Measures upload speed
5. **Settings** - Configure test parameters and server selection
6. **Export JSON** - Run tests and save results to a timestamped JSON file
7. **Exit** - Quit SpeedBuffy

The main menu also displays your current server selections for latency, download, and upload tests.

#### Server Selection

Each test (Quick, Latency, Download, Upload) offers the option to:
- Use the default server(s)
- Select a specific server for that test

For example, when running a latency test:
```
LATENCY TEST

1. Use default server (8.8.8.8)
2. Select a different server

Select an option (1-2): 2

Select latency server:
1. Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
2. Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1)
3. OpenDNS (208.67.222.222)
4. Custom server
```

#### Settings Menu

The Settings menu provides access to:
- Download Size configuration
- Download Time Cap configuration
- Upload Time Cap configuration
- IP Version selection
- Server Settings submenu

The Server Settings submenu allows you to configure default servers for all tests:
```
SERVER SETTINGS

1. Latency Server: 8.8.8.8
2. Download Server: All Available Servers
3. Upload Server: All Available Servers
4. Return to Settings
```

### Sample Visual Output

```
SERVER SELECTION

3. OTEnet (http://speedtest.ftp.otenet.gr/files/)
4. Tele2 (http://speedtest.tele2.net/)
5. Custom server
6. Use all servers (default)
Select an option (1-6): 1

Select upload server:
1. HTTPBin (https://httpbin.org/post)
2. Postman Echo (https://postman-echo.com/post)
3. Custom server
4. Use all servers (default)
Select an option (1-4): 1

```

## Robustness Features

- **Multiple Fallbacks**: If a test server fails, SpeedBuffy automatically tries alternative servers
- **Comprehensive Server Selection**: Choose from predefined servers or specify custom ones for all test types
- **Per-Test Server Selection**: Select servers individually for each test you run
- **Current Server Display**: Main menu shows which servers are currently selected
- **Server Reporting**: All outputs (visual, JSON, file) include the servers used for each test
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles network issues and timeouts
- **ASCII-only UI**: Works in any terminal without Unicode support
- **Color Auto-detection**: Automatically disables color when stdout isn't a TTY
- **Numeric Sanitization**: All values are sanitized to avoid blank/null values
- **Debug Logging**: Use `--debug` to write detailed logs to `/tmp/speedbuffy.log`
- **Zero Dependencies**: Uses only tools commonly available on Linux systems

## Default Server Configuration

By default, SpeedBuffy uses:
- Cloudflare for download tests
- Postman Echo for upload tests
