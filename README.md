## Why I built this
Sometimes you just want to **check your network speed quickly** without installing Python packages, Node modules, or heavy binaries like `speedtest-cli`. On a fresh Raspberry Pi or Linux box, it can be frustrating to pull in extra dependencies just for one test.

**SpeedBuffy** solves that. It‚Äôs a **zero-install speed test script** written in Bash, relying only on standard Linux utilities:

- `curl`
- `ping`
- `awk`
- `tput`

That‚Äôs it. No packages to install. Just download the script, make it executable, and run.

It‚Äôs designed to run **anywhere Linux is available** ‚Äî Raspberry Pi, Debian servers, even minimal cloud VMs ‚Äî and still give you:
- Latency tests
- Download tests
- Upload tests
- JSON export
- A fun ASCII UI

## Usage

### Quick start
```bash
chmod +x speedbuffy.sh
./speedbuffy.sh --quick
```

### Options
```
  --quick                   Run latency+download+upload (visuals) and exit
  --json                    Print JSON only and exit (no visuals/menu)
  --save-json               Like --json but also save to speedbuffy-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json
  --out-json FILE           Like --json but save to FILE (and still print to stdout)
  --size MB                 Download size (default 100)
  --dlcap SEC               Download time cap (default 30)
  --ulcap SEC               Upload time cap (default 20)
  --ipv 4|6|auto            Force IP family (default auto)
  --server NAME             hetzner|thinkbroadband|tele2 (default hetzner)
  --no-color|--color        Force disable/enable colors
  --debug                   Log internals to /tmp/speedbuffy.log
```

## Menu Options
Run without flags:
```bash
./speedbuffy.sh
```

You‚Äôll see an interactive menu:

```
Choose an option:
[1] Quick Test (10s latency + download + upload)
[2] Latency only (30s live)
[3] Download test
[4] Upload test
[5] Settings
[6] Export JSON (run full test + save file)
[0] Exit
```

### [1] Quick Test
- Runs a 10 second latency test with live updating bar.
- Then runs download + upload tests with per-chunk throughput in ASCII.
- Results shown on one screen with averages.

### [2] Latency only
- 30 second latency test.
- Shows packets sent/received in real time.
- Ends with average latency and jitter.

### [3] Download test
- Lets you use defaults (size, cap) or override.
- Performs per-chunk download with throughput per chunk.
- Reports total MB transferred, MB/s, Mb/s.

### [4] Upload test
- Same as download, but uploading generated zero-bytes to Tele2.
- Configurable chunk size and cap.

### [5] Settings
- Adjust server, IPv4/6, download size, caps.
- Values persist while the script is running.

### [6] Export JSON
- Runs full latency+download+upload.
- Saves results to a timestamped JSON file.
- Example filename: `speedbuffy-20250909-130000.json`

### [0] Exit
- Cleanly exits.

### JSON only
```bash
./speedbuffy.sh --json
```
Output:

```

## Notes
- Works great on Raspberry Pi and cloud servers.
- If HTTPS Range requests fail, SpeedBuffy auto-falls back to HTTP or full-file fetch.
- Pure ASCII (no Unicode boxes) for maximum compatibility.
- Debug mode (`--debug`) logs all curl details to `/tmp/speedbuffy.log`.
